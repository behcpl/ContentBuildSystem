# ContentBuildSystem
 A toolkit to convert source asset files into a format ready for your engine to use.

## Idea

Convert source asset files (like png) into some compressed/compiled output asset file in your custom format.

Conversion is rule based.

Rules apply to sets of data (example folder with sprites for a given atlas)
