# Generic Game Assets

This module is shared between tools and a game. It contains asset definition together with serialization methods.
No imports or processing should be added here.

### TODO

- Add sprite atlas
- Add font
- Add sound samples (or keep ogg?)
- Add meshes?
- Migrate to dedicated repo
